I have only tested this in Hatari 2.0/2.1. Please report whether this
works on real STe hardware or not. I would be extra grateful for
patches to make it work. I suspect that there could be timing issues
with the fullscreen code, and/or (perhaps more likely) the timing of
changing the hardware scroll registers (hscroll and hskip). If you
want public discussions, I'm "sigge" on atari-forum.org. I'd love to
hear your comments!
